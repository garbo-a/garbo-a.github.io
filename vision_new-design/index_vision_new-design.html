                        marketplaces to provide an easy, secure way to share files outside of an organization, and even
                        with the general public. Those who previously lacked access to new markets will have exposure to
                        a powerful buyer market. And enterprises will have a secure, private, protected environment to
                        connect globally—all empowered by the Avid MediaCentral Platform, with full access to control,
